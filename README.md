# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as age, gender, and ticket class, the model aims to uncover patterns that influenced survival outcomes. The objective is to apply data science methodologies to a historical dataset, enhancing understanding of classification problems and model evaluation.

# Technologies Used
Python (Primary Language)

Libraries:

Pandas (Data manipulation)

NumPy (Numerical computations)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine learning models and evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook (For interactive code execution)


# Conclusion
Through this project, a machine learning model was developed to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The final model achieved an accuracy of 81% on the training set and 79% on the test set. This endeavor provided practical experience in handling real-world datasets and applying machine learning techniques effectively.
