# Overview
This repository showcases the work completed during my CodSoft internship, which involved various machine learning tasks aimed at solving real-world problems. The tasks required using Python and machine learning libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.


# **Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**
Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Approach:

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values in the Age and Embarked columns and encoding categorical variables like Sex and Embarked.

I used Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to build a classification model.

The models were evaluated using accuracy metrics, with 81% accuracy on training data and 79% accuracy on test data.

This task helped me develop a strong understanding of classification problems and how to handle common challenges such as missing data and feature encoding.




# Technologies Used
Python (Primary Language)

Libraries:

Pandas (Data manipulation)

NumPy (Numerical computations)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine learning models and evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook (For interactive code execution)


# Conclusion
This repository showcases the key projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. The tasks gave me hands-on experience in machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and real-world problem-solving. I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in data science and machine learning.
